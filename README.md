My name is Rodrigo Müller, and I'm a Brazilian developer - although I've worked as Full-stack previously, I prefer working as Back-end developer. API and integrations <3

Checkpoint/Restore strategy for stateful applications. I have some public repositories about my research, like [this one](https://github.com/r-hmuller/http-interceptor-go)
